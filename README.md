# Item7-readability
this repository contains code for calculating the readability of "Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" from the annual report

Employing Item 7 of the 10-K reports over a 26-year period, this study examines the evolving readability of financial reporting. Using a dataset of more than 200,000 reports retrieved from SEC EDGAR filings, we observe a noticeable decline in readability over time. Using the Fog Index as a measure, we can see that each year, the number of years of schooling required to comprehend a given text grows by over a month. Financial reports are becoming increasingly inaccessible to a significant segment of the population as a result of this trend. Additionally, we incorporate data from diverse corpora encompassing almost 10 million documents, offering a broader understanding of financial text complexity. The Wall Street Journal stands as a notable exception to our finding that financial texts, in general, do not demonstrate a significant increase in complexity over time and may even exhibit a tendency to decrease in complexity.
